# Sane Extensions to MATLAB #
---

**S**ane **E**xtensions to **M**ATLAB (sxm) is a library of MATLAB functions and classes which perform some useful tasks in a much saner way than MATLAB does natively.

A brief overview of features:

 - ADTs
	 - List
	 - Set
 - Wrappers around common MATLAB operations
	 - Plotting
	 - Solving BVPs
 - Numerical methods
	 - Numerical differentiation
		 - Forward difference
		 - Backward difference
		 - Central difference
 	 - Linear systems of equations
	 	 - Naive Gaussian elimination
	 - IVP solving
		 - Euler's method
	 - Monte Carlo methods
 - Performance testing extensions
	 - Raising square matrices to arbitrary powers
	 - Summing arbitrarily large vectors
	 - Naive Gaussian solution of arbitrarily large Hilbert matrices
	 - Euler's method for arbitrary number of steps
 - Various mathematical utilities of historical interest
